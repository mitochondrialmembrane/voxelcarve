# voxelcarve

In this project, I attempted to implement multi-sweep space carving outlined in “[A Theory of Space-Carving](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kyros/pubs/00.ijcv.carve.pdf).” To run the project, run `voxelcarve.py`.

## Results
The resultant carved voxel grid, for the most part, resembles the original model, though it had a hard time carving in areas with heavy shadows, the top of the head, and near the legs.
